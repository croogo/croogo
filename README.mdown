## Requirements
  * Apache with `mod_rewrite`
  * PHP 5.3 or higher
  * MySQL 4.1 or higher

## Installation

#### Installation using composer

The preferred way to install Croogo is by using [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

    composer create-project croogo/app myapp
    cd myapp
    composer install

#### Web based installer

  * Extract the archive. Upload the content to your server.
  * Create a new MySQL database (`utf8_unicode_ci` collation)
  * visit http://your-site.com/ from your browser and follow the instructions.

#### Manual installation

  * Extract the archive. Upload the content to your server.
  * Locate your `app` directory, and rename the following files:
    * `Config/database.php.install` to `database.php`, and edit the details.
    * `Config/croogo.php.install` to `croogo.php`, and edit the details.
    * `Config/settings.json.install` to `settings.json`
  * You can access your admin panel at http://your-site.com/admin. The installer should
    display a page for you to create the administrative user.

#### Installation using git

Beginning version 2.0.0, Croogo has been updated to be installed as a vendor
package. This is intended to ease integration with an existing cakephp
application.

  * Ensure you have a recent cakephp version 2.5
  * Run the following commands:

    git clone git://github.com/croogo/app app &&
    cd app && Console/add_submodule

  * If you intend to modify the default administration theme, you will need
    to regenerate the assets by running the following command from the
    application root directory:

    `Console/cake croogo make`

    The above command will fetch twitter bootstrap and FontAwesome
    and subsequently compile the CSS assets using lessphp.

    Alternatively, you could use `lessc` or `recess` as the compiler as they
    generate a better result.  Edit the `COMPILE` value in the `Makefile`
    accordingly and run:

    `( cd Vendor/croogo/croogo/Croogo ; make )`
